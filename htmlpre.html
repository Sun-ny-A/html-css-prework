                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Senait. I don't usually post about myself online so this is a bit awkward for me but I'll make do. My favorite hobbies include traveling and art. Sadly, I haven't gone abroad in quite some time due to covid. Funny enough, my last big trip was December 2019 right before the pandemic hit. I went to Cape Town, South Africa with a friend for 2 weeks, then traveled all over Morocco for a week, and stopped by Madrid, Spain for a long layover before coming back to the States. I came back January 2020 and a few months later we were in lockdown for the next 2 years. I'm grateful for the month long adventure I had before the pandemic hit. </p>
                <br />
                <p>I am excited for this software engineering program and to graduate as a full stack developer. My long term goal is to pursue working in artificial intelligence. It's a relatively new field that has unlimited potential. I want to be part of this momentum and help make advancements especially in healthcare and global health. First step, graduate from Coding Temple. Wish me luck!</p>
